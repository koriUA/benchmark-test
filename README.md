# cui-react-application

##### This repository serves as base of development structures, it aligns key elements across cui/react applications:
 - main libraries dependencies and settings (including react/redux)
 - common pattern for git hooks to perform commit linting checks and trigger unit tests on push events
 - decibel and shell initialisation
 - webpack configuration and build settings
 - folder/file structure, so that moving elements between streams, migrating components to decibel library or context switching for developers should be relatively easy
